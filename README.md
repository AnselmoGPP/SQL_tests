# SQLite tests

<br>![SQLite logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnselmoGPP/Template_project/master/more/SQLite_logo.png)

Here I show how to use SQLite with C++. I also implement useful functions for parsing and processing data from databases.

Folders in "projects":

- "tests": Parsing a CSV and creation of a DB.

- "world_cities": Application that uses the previously created DB that allows the user to query and get data about cities of the world.
