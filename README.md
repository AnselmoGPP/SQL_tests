# SQLite tests

<br>![SQLite logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnselmoGPP/SQL_tests/master/more/SQLite_logo.png)

Here I show how to use SQLite with C++. I also implement useful functions for parsing and processing data from databases.

Folders in "projects":

- "tests": Basic SQL operations.

- "world_cities": Parsing a CSV, creation of a DB, and creation of an application that, using that DB, allows the user to query and get data about cities of the world.
